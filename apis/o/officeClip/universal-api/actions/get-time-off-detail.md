  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"

  connectionId
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/officeClip/latest/actions/get-time-off-detail?${params}`, {

```



## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native OfficeClip API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native OfficeClip API, this operation is `GET /api/timeoff-detail/{id}` (base URL `https://app.officeclip.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-time-off-detail.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
