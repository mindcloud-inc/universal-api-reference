```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as JSON body fields ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |

| `temporaryPassword` | string | no |  |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Outseta API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Outseta API, this operation is `PUT /crm/people/:personUid/setTemporaryPassword` (base URL `https://{{credentials.subdomain}}.outseta.com/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/set-temporary-password.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
