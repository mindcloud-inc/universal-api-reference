## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native OpenRouter API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native OpenRouter API, this operation is `GET /guardrails/assignments/keys` (base URL `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-guardrail-key-assignments.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
