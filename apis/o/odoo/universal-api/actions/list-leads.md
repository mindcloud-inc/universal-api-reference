```

```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId,
  limit: '25',
  offset: '0'
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/odoo/latest/actions/list-leads?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

    }
  ],
  "meta": {}
}
```

## Native endpoint

Through the native Odoo API, this operation is `POST /ir.cron/search_read` (base URL `https://{{credentials.domain}}/json/2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication and pagination. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-leads.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
