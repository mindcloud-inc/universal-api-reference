## Native endpoint

Through the native Odoo API, this operation is `POST /mail.activity/search_read` (base URL `https://{{credentials.domain}}/json/2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication and pagination. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-activities.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
