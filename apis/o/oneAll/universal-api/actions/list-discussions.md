## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native OneAll API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native OneAll API, this operation is `GET /loudvoice/discussions.json` (base URL `https://mindcloudco.api.oneall.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-discussions.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
