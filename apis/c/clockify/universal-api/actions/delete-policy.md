## Native endpoint

Through the native Clockify API, this operation is `DELETE workspaces/:workspaceId/time-off/policies/:id` (base URL `https://api.clockify.me/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-policy.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
