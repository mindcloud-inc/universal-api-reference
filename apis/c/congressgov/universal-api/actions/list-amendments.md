# Congress.gov: List Amendments

Retrieves amendments from Congress.gov.

```
GET https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/congressgov/latest/actions/list-amendments
```

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId,
  limit: '25',
  offset: '0'
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/congressgov/latest/actions/list-amendments?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```
