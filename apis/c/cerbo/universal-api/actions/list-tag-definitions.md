## Example request

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"

  connectionId
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/cerbo/latest/actions/list-tag-definitions?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as query string parameters ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Advanced

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `include_deleted` | boolean | no | Defaults to false, but any non-empty value will include deleted tags in the returned array |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Cerbo API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Cerbo API, this operation is `GET /tags` (base URL `https://{{credentials.tenant}}.md-hq.com/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-tag-definitions.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
