## Native endpoint

Through the native CircleCI API, this operation is `DELETE /schedule/:schedule_id` (base URL `https://circleci.com/api/v2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-schedule.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
