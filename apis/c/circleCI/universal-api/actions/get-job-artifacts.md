## Native endpoint

Through the native CircleCI API, this operation is `GET /project/:project_slug/:job_number/artifacts` (base URL `https://circleci.com/api/v2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-job-artifacts.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
