## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Comm100 API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Comm100 API, this operation is `GET livechat/campaigns/{{id}}/manualInvitation` (base URL `https://api17.comm100.io/v4`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-campaign-manual-invitation.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
