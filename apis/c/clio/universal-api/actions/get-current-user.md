## Native endpoint

Through the native Clio Manage API, this operation is `GET /users/who_am_i.json` (base URL `https://app.clio.com/api/v4`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-current-user.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
