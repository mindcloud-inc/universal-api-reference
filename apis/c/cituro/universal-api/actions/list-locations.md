## Native endpoint

Through the native Cituro API, this operation is `GET /locations` (base URL `https://app.cituro.com/api`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-locations.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
