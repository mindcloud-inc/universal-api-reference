## Native endpoint

Through the native Liveblocks API, this operation is `GET /users/:userId/groups` (base URL `https://api.liveblocks.io/v2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-user-groups.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
