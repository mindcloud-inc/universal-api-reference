## Native endpoint

Through the native Leap API, this operation is `GET /jobs/[:jobId]` (base URL `https://api.jobprogress.com/api/v3`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-job.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
