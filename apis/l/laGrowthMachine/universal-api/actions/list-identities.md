## Native endpoint

Through the native LaGrowthMachine API, this operation is `GET /identities` (base URL `https://apiv2.lagrowthmachine.com/flow`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-identities.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
