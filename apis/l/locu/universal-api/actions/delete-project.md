## Native endpoint

Through the native Locu API, this operation is `DELETE /projects/:id` (base URL `https://api.locu.app/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-project.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
