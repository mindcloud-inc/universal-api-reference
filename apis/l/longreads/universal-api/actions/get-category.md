## Native endpoint

Through the native Longreads API, this operation is `GET /wp/v2/categories/{id}` (base URL `https://longreads.com/wp-json`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-category.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
