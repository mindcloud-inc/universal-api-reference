## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Launch27 API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Launch27 API, this operation is `GET quote/custom_fields` (base URL `https://{{credentials.subdomain}}.launch27.com/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-quote-custom-fields.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
