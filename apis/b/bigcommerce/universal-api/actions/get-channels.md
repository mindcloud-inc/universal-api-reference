  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native BigCommerce API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native BigCommerce API, this operation is `GET /v3/channels` (base URL `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{credentials.storeHash}}`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-channels.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
