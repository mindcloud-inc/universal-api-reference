    'Content-Type': 'application/json'

  body: JSON.stringify({
    connectionId,
    "id": "string"

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as JSON body fields ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | yes |  |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Bluebarry API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Bluebarry API, this operation is `PATCH /data/Advisors({id})` (base URL `https://data.bluebarry.ai/`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/update-advisor.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
