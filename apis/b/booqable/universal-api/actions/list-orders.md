```
GET https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/booqable/latest/actions/list-orders
```

Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY` and pass a Booqable `connectionId` ([setup](../authentication.md)).

curl -X GET "https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/booqable/latest/actions/list-orders?connectionId=$CONNECTION_ID&limit=25&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId,
  limit: '25',
  offset: '0'
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/booqable/latest/actions/list-orders?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }

The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication and pagination. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-orders.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
