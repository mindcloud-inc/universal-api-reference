## Native endpoint

Through the native Blockscout API, this operation is `GET /:chain_id/api/v2/addresses` (base URL `https://api.blockscout.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-addresses.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
