# BambooHR: Get Alert Configuration

Retrieves alert configuration from BambooHR.

```
GET https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/bambooHrV2/latest/actions/get-alert-configuration
```

Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY` and pass a BambooHR `connectionId` ([setup](../authentication.md)).

## Example request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/bambooHrV2/latest/actions/get-alert-configuration?connectionId=$CONNECTION_ID&id=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId,
  "id": "1"
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/bambooHrV2/latest/actions/get-alert-configuration?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as query string parameters ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | number | yes | Identifier of the alert configuration to return, as emitted in the `id` field of **List Alert Configurations** (`list-alert-configurations`). This is the configuration's own identifier, not the `bambooAlertId` of the alert template it is based on. No wildcard or `0` sentinel is supported; enumerate configurations with `list-alert-configurations` instead. |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native BambooHR API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native BambooHR API, this operation is `GET /v1/alert-configurations/:id` (base URL `https://{{credentials.companyDomain}}.bamboohr.com/api`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-alert-configuration.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
