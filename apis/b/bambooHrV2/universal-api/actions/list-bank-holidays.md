## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native BambooHR API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native BambooHR API, this operation is `GET /v1/meta/bank-holidays` (base URL `https://{{credentials.companyDomain}}.bamboohr.com/api`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-bank-holidays.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
