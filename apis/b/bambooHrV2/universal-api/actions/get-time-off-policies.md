## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native BambooHR API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native BambooHR API, this operation is `GET /v1/meta/time_off/policies` (base URL `https://mindcloud.bamboohr.com/api`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-time-off-policies.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
