## Example request

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/bulldogWP/latest/actions/download-file?${params}`, {
  headers: {

});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as query string parameters ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fileId` | string | yes | Uploaded file resource ID. |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Bulldog-WP API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Bulldog-WP API, this operation is `GET /files/{fileId}/download` (base URL `https://api.bulldog-wp.co.il/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/download-file.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
