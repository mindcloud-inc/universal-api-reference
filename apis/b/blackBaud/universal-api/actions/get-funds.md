## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native BlackBaud API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native BlackBaud API, this operation is `GET fundraising/v1/funds` (base URL `https://api.sky.blackbaud.com/`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-funds.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
