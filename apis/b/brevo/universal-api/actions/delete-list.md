## Native endpoint

Through the native Brevo API, this operation is `DELETE /v3/contacts/lists/:listId` (base URL `https://api.brevo.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-list.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
