## Native endpoint

Through the native Pingdom API, this operation is `DELETE /alerting/contacts/:contactid` (base URL `https://api.pingdom.com/api/3.1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-contact.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
