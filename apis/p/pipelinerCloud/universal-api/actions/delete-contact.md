## Native endpoint

Through the native Pipeliner Cloud API, this operation is `DELETE /entities/Contacts/{{id}}` (base URL `{{credentials.serviceUrl}}/api/v100/rest/spaces/{{credentials.spaceId}}`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-contact.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
