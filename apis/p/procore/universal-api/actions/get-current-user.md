# Procore: Get Current User

Retrieves current user details from Procore.

```
GET https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/procore/latest/actions/get-current-user
```

Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY` and pass a Procore `connectionId` ([setup](../authentication.md)).

## Example request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/procore/latest/actions/get-current-user?connectionId=$CONNECTION_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/procore/latest/actions/get-current-user?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```



## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Procore API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Procore API, this operation is `GET /rest/v1.0/me` (base URL `https://api.procore.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-current-user.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
