## Native endpoint

Through the native Port API AI API, this operation is `DELETE /teams/:name` (base URL `https://api.port.io/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-team.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
