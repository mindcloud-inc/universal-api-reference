## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Polymer API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Polymer API, this operation is `GET /job_applications/:job_application_id/reviews` (base URL `https://api.polymer.co/v1/hire`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-job-application-reviews.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
