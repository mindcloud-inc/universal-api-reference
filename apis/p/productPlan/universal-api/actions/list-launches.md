## Native endpoint

Through the native ProductPlan API, this operation is `GET /launches` (base URL `https://app.productplan.com/api/v2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-launches.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
