## Native endpoint

Through the native PlatoForms API, this operation is `GET /me/` (base URL `https://api.platoforms.com/v4`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-api-user-information.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
