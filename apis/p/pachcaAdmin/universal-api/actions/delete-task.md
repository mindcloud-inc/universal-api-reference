## Native endpoint

Through the native Pachca (Admin) API, this operation is `DELETE /tasks/:id` (base URL `https://api.pachca.com/api/shared/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-task.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
