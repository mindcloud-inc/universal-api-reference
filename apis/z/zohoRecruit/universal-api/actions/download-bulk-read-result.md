## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Zoho Recruit API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Zoho Recruit API, this operation is `GET https://recruit.zoho.com/recruit/bulk/v2/read/:jobId/result` (base URL `https://recruit.zoho.com/recruit/v2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/download-bulk-read-result.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
