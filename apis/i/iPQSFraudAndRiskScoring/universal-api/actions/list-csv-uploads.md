## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native IPQS Fraud and Risk Scoring API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native IPQS Fraud and Risk Scoring API, this operation is `GET /csv/list` (base URL `https://www.ipqualityscore.com/api/json`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-csv-uploads.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
