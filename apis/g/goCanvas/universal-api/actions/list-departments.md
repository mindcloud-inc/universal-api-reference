## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native GoCanvas API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native GoCanvas API, this operation is `GET /departments` (base URL `https://www.gocanvas.com/api/v3`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-departments.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
