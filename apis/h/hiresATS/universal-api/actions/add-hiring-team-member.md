## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native 100Hires ATS API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native 100Hires ATS API, this operation is `POST /jobs/:id/hiring-team` (base URL `https://api.100hires.com/v2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/add-hiring-team-member.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
