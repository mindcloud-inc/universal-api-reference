# Hightouch: List Event Contracts

Retrieves event contracts from Hightouch.

```
GET https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/hightouch/latest/actions/list-event-contracts
```

Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY` and pass a Hightouch `connectionId` ([setup](../authentication.md)).

This action also supports [pagination](../pagination.md) (`limit`, `offset`), [sorting](../sorting.md) (`sort`).

## Example request

curl -X GET "https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/hightouch/latest/actions/list-event-contracts?connectionId=$CONNECTION_ID&limit=25&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId,
  limit: '25',
  offset: '0'
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/hightouch/latest/actions/list-event-contracts?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Native endpoint

Through the native Hightouch API, this operation is `GET /events/contracts` (base URL `https://api.hightouch.com/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication and pagination. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-event-contracts.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
