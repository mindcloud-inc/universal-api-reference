  offset: '0'
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/assemblycom/latest/actions/list-subscriptions?${params}`, {

## Native endpoint

Through the native Assembly.com API, this operation is `GET /subscriptions` (base URL `https://api.assembly.com/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication and pagination. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-subscriptions.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
