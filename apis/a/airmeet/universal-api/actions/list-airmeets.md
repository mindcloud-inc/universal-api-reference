## Inputs

Arguments are sent as query string parameters ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Airmeet API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Airmeet API, this operation is `GET /airmeets` (base URL `https://api-gateway-prod.us.airmeet.com/prod`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-airmeets.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
