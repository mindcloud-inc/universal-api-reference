Through the native actiTIME API, this operation is `GET /departments/:id` (base URL `{{credentials.instanceUrl}}/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-department.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
