## Native endpoint

Through the native Appwrite API, this operation is `DELETE /databases/{databaseId}/collections/{collectionId}/indexes/{key}` (base URL `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/databases-delete-index.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
