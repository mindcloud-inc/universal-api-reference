## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Amazing Marvin API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Amazing Marvin API, this operation is `GET /goals` (base URL `https://serv.amazingmarvin.com/api`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-goals.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
