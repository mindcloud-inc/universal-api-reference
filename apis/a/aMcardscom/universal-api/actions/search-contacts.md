```

## Example request

curl -X GET "https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/aMcardscom/latest/actions/search-contacts?connectionId=$CONNECTION_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/aMcardscom/latest/actions/search-contacts?${params}`, {

});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as query string parameters ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | string | no | Text to search across contacts. |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native AMcards.com API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native AMcards.com API, this operation is `GET /contact/search/` (base URL `https://amcards.com/.api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/search-contacts.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
