## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Seafile API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Seafile API, this operation is `GET https://plus.seafile.com/api2/beshared-repos/` (base URL `https://plus.seafile.com/api2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-libraries-shared-to-me.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
