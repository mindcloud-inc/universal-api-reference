const response = await fetch('https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/sarbacane/latest/actions/manage-campaign-teams', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`,

    connectionId
  })
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```



## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Sarbacane API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Sarbacane API, this operation is `PUT /campaigns/{campaignId}/teams` (base URL `https://api.sarbacane.com/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/manage-campaign-teams.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
