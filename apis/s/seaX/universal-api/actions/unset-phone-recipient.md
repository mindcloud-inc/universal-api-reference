## Native endpoint

Through the native SeaX API, this operation is `POST /phones/{phone_id}/unset_recipient` (base URL `https://seax.seasalt.ai/seax-api/api/v1/workspace/{{credentials.workspaceId}}`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/unset-phone-recipient.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
