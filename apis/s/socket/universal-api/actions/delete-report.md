## Native endpoint

Through the native Socket API, this operation is `DELETE /report/delete/:id` (base URL `https://api.socket.dev/v0`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-report.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
