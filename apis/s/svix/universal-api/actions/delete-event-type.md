## Native endpoint

Through the native Svix API, this operation is `DELETE /api/v1/event-type/{event_type_name}` (base URL `https://api.us.svix.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-event-type.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
