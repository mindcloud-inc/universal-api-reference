  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`,

  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    connectionId
  })
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as JSON body fields ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native StoryChief API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native StoryChief API, this operation is `POST /categories` (base URL `https://api.storychief.io/1.0`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/create-category.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
