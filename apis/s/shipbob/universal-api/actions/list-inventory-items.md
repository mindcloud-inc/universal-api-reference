## Example request

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/shipbob/latest/actions/list-inventory-items?${params}`, {

  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```



## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native ShipBob API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native ShipBob API, this operation is `GET 1.0/inventory` (base URL `https://{{credentials.apiSubdomain}}.shipbob.com/`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-inventory-items.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
