## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native ScrapeOps API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native ScrapeOps API, this operation is `GET https://proxy.scrapeops.io/v1/structured-data/walmart/browse` (base URL `http://headers.scrapeops.io/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/browse-walmart-products.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
