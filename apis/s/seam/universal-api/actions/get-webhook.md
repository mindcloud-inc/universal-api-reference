## Native endpoint

Through the native Seam API, this operation is `POST /webhooks/get` (base URL `https://connect.getseam.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-webhook.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
