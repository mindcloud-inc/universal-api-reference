## Native endpoint

Through the native Sharetribe API, this operation is `POST listings/approve` (base URL `https://flex-integ-api.sharetribe.com/v1/integration_api`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/approve-listing.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
