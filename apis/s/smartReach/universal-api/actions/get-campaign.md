## Native endpoint

Through the native SmartReach API, this operation is `GET /campaigns/:campaign_id` (base URL `https://api.smartreach.io/api/v3`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-campaign.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
