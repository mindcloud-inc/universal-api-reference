## Native endpoint

Through the native DigiCert API, this operation is `GET /container` (base URL `https://www.digicert.com/services/v2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-containers.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
