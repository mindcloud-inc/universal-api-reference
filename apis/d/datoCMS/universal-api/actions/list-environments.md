## Native endpoint

Through the native DatoCMS API, this operation is `GET /environments` (base URL `https://site-api.datocms.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-environments.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
