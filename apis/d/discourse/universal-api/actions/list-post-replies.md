## Native endpoint

Through the native Discourse API, this operation is `GET /posts/:id/replies.json` (base URL `https://mindcloud.discourse.group`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-post-replies.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
