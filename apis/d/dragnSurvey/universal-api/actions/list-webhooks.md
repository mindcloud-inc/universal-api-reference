## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Drag'n Survey API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Drag'n Survey API, this operation is `GET webhooks` (base URL `https://developer.dragnsurvey.com/api/v2.0.0`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-webhooks.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
