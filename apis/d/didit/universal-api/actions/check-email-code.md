  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    connectionId,
    "code": "string",
    "email": "ava@example.com"
  })
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as JSON body fields ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | string | yes | Verification code received by email. |
| `email` | string | yes | Email address used during verification. |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Didit API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Didit API, this operation is `POST https://verification.didit.me/v3/email/check/` (base URL `https://verification.didit.me/v3`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/check-email-code.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
