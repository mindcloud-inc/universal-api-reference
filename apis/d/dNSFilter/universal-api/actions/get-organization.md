## Native endpoint

Through the native DNSFilter API, this operation is `GET /v1/organizations/:id` (base URL `https://api.dnsfilter.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-organization.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
