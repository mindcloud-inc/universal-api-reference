```
GET https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/teamgate/latest/actions/list-leads
```

Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY` and pass a Teamgate `connectionId` ([setup](../authentication.md)).

This action also supports [pagination](../pagination.md) (`limit`, `offset`), [filtering](../filtering.md) (`where`), [sorting](../sorting.md) (`sort`).

## Example request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/teamgate/latest/actions/list-leads?connectionId=$CONNECTION_ID&limit=25&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId,
  limit: '25',
  offset: '0'
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/teamgate/latest/actions/list-leads?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
