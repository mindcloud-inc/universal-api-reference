## Native endpoint

Through the native Thinkific API, this operation is `GET /groups/:id` (base URL `https://api.thinkific.com/api/public/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-group.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
