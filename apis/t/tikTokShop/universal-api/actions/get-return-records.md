## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native TikTok Shop API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native TikTok Shop API, this operation is `GET /return_refund/202309/returns/:return_id/records` (base URL `https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com/`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-return-records.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
