## Native endpoint

Through the native TeamBook API, this operation is `GET /clients/{clientId}` (base URL `https://web.teambookapp.com/api/public`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-client.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
