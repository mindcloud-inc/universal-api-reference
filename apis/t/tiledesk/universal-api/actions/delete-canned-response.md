## Native endpoint

Through the native Tiledesk API, this operation is `DELETE /{{credentials.projectId}}/canned/:id` (base URL `https://api.tiledesk.com/v3`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-canned-response.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
