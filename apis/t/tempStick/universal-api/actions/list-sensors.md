```

## Example request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/tempStick/latest/actions/list-sensors?connectionId=$CONNECTION_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/tempStick/latest/actions/list-sensors?${params}`, {

  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```



## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Temp Stick API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Temp Stick API, this operation is `GET /sensors/all` (base URL `https://tempstickapi.com/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-sensors.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
