## Native endpoint

Through the native Typeform API, this operation is `DELETE /forms/:formId/webhooks/:tag` (base URL `https://api.typeform.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-webhook.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
