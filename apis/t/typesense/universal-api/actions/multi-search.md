## Native endpoint

Through the native Typesense API, this operation is `POST /multi_search` (base URL `https://5brh8vz1lictf0jop-1.a2.typesense.net`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/multi-search.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
