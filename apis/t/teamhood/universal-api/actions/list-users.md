## Native endpoint

Through the native Teamhood API, this operation is `GET /users` (base URL `https://api-mindcloud1.teamhood.com/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-users.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
