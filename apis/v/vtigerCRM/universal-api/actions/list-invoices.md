## Native endpoint

Through the native Vtiger CRM API, this operation is `GET /query?query=select+id%2C+subject+from+Invoice+limit+0%2C+25%3B` (base URL `{{credentials.apiBaseUrl}}`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-invoices.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
