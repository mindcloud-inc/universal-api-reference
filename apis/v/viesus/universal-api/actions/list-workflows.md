## Native endpoint

Through the native Viesus API, this operation is `POST /` (base URL `https://api.viesus.cloud/graphql`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-workflows.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
