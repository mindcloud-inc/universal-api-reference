## Native endpoint

Through the native Vooplayer API, this operation is `POST /groups` (base URL `https://api.spotlightr.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/create-project.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
