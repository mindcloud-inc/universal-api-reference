## Inputs

Arguments are sent as query string parameters ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Vouchery.io API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Vouchery.io API, this operation is `GET /campaigns/:campaign_id/stats` (base URL `https://mindcloud.sandbox.vouchery.app/api/v2.1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-campaign-statistics.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
