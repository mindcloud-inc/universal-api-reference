});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```



## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Visma eAccounting API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Visma eAccounting API, this operation is `POST /customerinvoices/{invoiceId}/email` (base URL `https://eaccountingapi.vismaonline.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/send-customer-invoice-email.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
