## Native endpoint

Through the native Yeti Snow API, this operation is `GET history/site/show` (base URL `https://sandbox_api.yetisoftware.com/api/en/public_access/1715`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-site-history.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
