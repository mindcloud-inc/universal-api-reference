# Exa: List Webhooks

Retrieves webhooks from Exa.

```
GET https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/exa/latest/actions/list-webhooks
```

Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY` and pass a Exa `connectionId` ([setup](../authentication.md)).

This action also supports [pagination](../pagination.md) (`limit`, `offset`).

## Example request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/exa/latest/actions/list-webhooks?connectionId=$CONNECTION_ID&limit=25&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId,
  limit: '25',
  offset: '0'
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/exa/latest/actions/list-webhooks?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```



## Response

  "success": true,

    {
      "data": [
        {}
      ],
      "hasMore": true,
      "nextCursor": "string"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {}
}
```

### Response fields

## Native endpoint

Through the native Exa API, this operation is `GET /websets/v0/webhooks` (base URL `https://api.exa.ai`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication and pagination. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-webhooks.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
