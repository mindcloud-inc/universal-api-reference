## Native endpoint

Through the native EyeLevel.ai API, this operation is `DELETE /group/:groupId` (base URL `https://api.groundx.ai/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-group.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
