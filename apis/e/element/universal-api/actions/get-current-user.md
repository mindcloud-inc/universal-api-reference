## Native endpoint

Through the native Element API, this operation is `GET /_matrix/client/v3/account/whoami` (base URL `{{credentials.homeserverUrl}}`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-current-user.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
