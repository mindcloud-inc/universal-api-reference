## Native endpoint

Through the native Envoy for Visitors API, this operation is `GET /employees/:id` (base URL `https://api.envoy.com/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-employee.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
