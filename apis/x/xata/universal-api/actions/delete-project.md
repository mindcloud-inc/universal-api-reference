## Native endpoint

Through the native Xata API, this operation is `DELETE /organizations/:organizationID/projects/:projectID` (base URL `https://api.xata.tech`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-project.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
