## Inputs

Arguments are sent as JSON body fields ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |

| `campaignId` | string | yes | The ID of the draft campaign that you want to test. |
| `testEmails` | list<object> | yes | A list of email addresses that you want to use to send your test campaign. Use a comma (,) to separate up to a maximum of five email addresses. |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Moosend API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Moosend API, this operation is `POST /campaigns/{{CampaignID}}/send-test.json` (base URL `https://api.moosend.com/v3`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/test-campaign.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
