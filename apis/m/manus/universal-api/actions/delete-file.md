## Native endpoint

Through the native Manus API, this operation is `DELETE /files/:file_id` (base URL `https://api.manus.ai/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-file.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
