## Native endpoint

Through the native Make API, this operation is `GET /connections` (base URL `https://us2.make.com/api/v2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-connections.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
