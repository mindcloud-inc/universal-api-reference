```

Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY` and pass a Merge Agent Handler `connectionId` ([setup](../authentication.md)).

## Example request

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/mergeAgentHandler/latest/actions/disconnect-registered-user-connector?connectionId=$CONNECTION_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/mergeAgentHandler/latest/actions/disconnect-registered-user-connector?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as query string parameters ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |

| `connectorSlug` | string | no | Slug of the connector. |
| `registeredUserId` | string | no | ID of the registered user. |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Merge Agent Handler API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Merge Agent Handler API, this operation is `DELETE /credentials/registered-users/:registered_user_id/connectors/:connector_slug/` (base URL `https://ah-api.merge.dev/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/disconnect-registered-user-connector.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
