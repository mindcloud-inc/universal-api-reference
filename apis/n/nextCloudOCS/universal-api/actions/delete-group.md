Through the native Next Cloud OCS API, this operation is `DELETE /ocs/v1.php/cloud/groups/{{groupId}}` (base URL `https://demo2.nextcloud.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-group.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
