## Native endpoint

Through the native Neon API, this operation is `GET /auth` (base URL `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-auth-details.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
