## Native endpoint

Through the native Nango API, this operation is `DELETE /integrations/:providerConfigKey` (base URL `https://api.nango.dev`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-integration.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
