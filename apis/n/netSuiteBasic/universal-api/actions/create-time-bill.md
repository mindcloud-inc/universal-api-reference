## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native NetSuite - Basic API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native NetSuite - Basic API, this operation is `POST /record/v1/timeBill` (base URL `https://{{credentials.accountDomain}}.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com/services/rest`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/create-time-bill.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
