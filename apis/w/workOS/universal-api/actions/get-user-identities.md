## Native endpoint

Through the native WorkOS API, this operation is `GET /user_management/users/{id}/identities` (base URL `https://api.workos.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-user-identities.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
