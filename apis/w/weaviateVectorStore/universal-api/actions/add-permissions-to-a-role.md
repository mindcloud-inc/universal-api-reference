## Example request

  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    connectionId,
    "id": "string"
  })
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as JSON body fields ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | yes | The name (ID) of the role being modified. |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Weaviate Vector Store API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Weaviate Vector Store API, this operation is `POST /authz/roles/:id/add-permissions` (base URL `https://tl3apaxxsoiuwhpnsdv19a.c0.us-west3.gcp.weaviate.cloud`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/add-permissions-to-a-role.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
