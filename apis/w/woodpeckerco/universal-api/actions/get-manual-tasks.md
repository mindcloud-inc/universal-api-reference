## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Woodpecker.co API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Woodpecker.co API, this operation is `GET /rest/v2/manual_tasks` (base URL `https://api.woodpecker.co`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-manual-tasks.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
