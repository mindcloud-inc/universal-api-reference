## Native endpoint

Through the native Worksnaps API, this operation is `GET /projects/{project_id}/tasks/{task_id}.xml` (base URL `https://api.worksnaps.com/api`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-a-task.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
