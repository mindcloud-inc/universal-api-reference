## Native endpoint

Through the native Upstash Redis API, this operation is `GET /del/:key` (base URL `https://choice-oriole-98954.upstash.io`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-key.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
