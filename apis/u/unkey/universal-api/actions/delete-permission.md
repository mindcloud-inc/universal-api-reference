## Native endpoint

Through the native Unkey API, this operation is `POST /v2/permissions.deletePermission` (base URL `https://api.unkey.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-permission.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
