## Native endpoint

Through the native Returnless API, this operation is `GET /2025-01/account` (base URL `https://api-v2.returnless.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-current-account.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
