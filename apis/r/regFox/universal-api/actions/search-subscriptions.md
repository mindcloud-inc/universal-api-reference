## Native endpoint

Through the native RegFox API, this operation is `GET search/subscriptions` (base URL `https://api.webconnex.com/v2/public`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/search-subscriptions.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
