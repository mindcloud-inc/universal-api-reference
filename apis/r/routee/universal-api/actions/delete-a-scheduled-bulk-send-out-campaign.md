## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Routee API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Routee API, this operation is `DELETE /sms/:trackingId` (base URL `https://connect.routee.net`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-a-scheduled-bulk-send-out-campaign.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
