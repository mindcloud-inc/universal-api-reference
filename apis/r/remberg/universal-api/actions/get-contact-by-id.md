const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/remberg/latest/actions/get-contact-by-id?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as query string parameters ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native remberg API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native remberg API, this operation is `GET /v1/contacts/{id}` (base URL `https://api.remberg.de`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-contact-by-id.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
