# Reddit Lead Ads: List My Businesses

Retrieves businesses for the authenticated user from Reddit Ads.

```
GET https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/redditAds/latest/actions/list-my-businesses
```

Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY` and pass a Reddit Lead Ads `connectionId` ([setup](../authentication.md)).

This action also supports [pagination](../pagination.md) (`limit`, `offset`).

```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId,
  limit: '25',
  offset: '0'
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/redditAds/latest/actions/list-my-businesses?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Native endpoint

Through the native Reddit Lead Ads API, this operation is `GET /me/businesses` (base URL `https://ads-api.reddit.com/api/v3`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication and pagination. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-my-businesses.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
