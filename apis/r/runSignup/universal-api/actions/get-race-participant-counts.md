const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/runSignup/latest/actions/get-race-participant-counts?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as query string parameters ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| `eventId` | string | yes | ID of event or list of event IDs separated by commas. |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native RunSignup API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native RunSignup API, this operation is `GET /race/:race_id/participant-counts` (base URL `https://api.runsignup.com/rest`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-race-participant-counts.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
