## Native endpoint

Through the native Rollbar API, this operation is `DELETE /service_links/:id` (base URL `https://api.rollbar.com/api/1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-service-link.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
