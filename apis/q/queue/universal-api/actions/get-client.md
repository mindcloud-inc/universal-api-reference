## Native endpoint

Through the native Queue API, this operation is `GET clients/:client_id` (base URL `https://app.usequeue.com/api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-client.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
