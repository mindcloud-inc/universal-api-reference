## Native endpoint

Through the native JetAPI API, this operation is `GET /api/v1/webhooks/` (base URL `https://api.jetapi.io`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-webhooks.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
