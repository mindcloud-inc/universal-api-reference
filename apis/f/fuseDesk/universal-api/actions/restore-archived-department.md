## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native FuseDesk API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native FuseDesk API, this operation is `POST /api/v2/departments/:departmentId/restore` (base URL `https://{{credentials.appName}}.fusedesk.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/restore-archived-department.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
