## Example request

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/fuseDesk/latest/actions/close-chat" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

}'
```

const response = await fetch('https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/fuseDesk/latest/actions/close-chat', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    connectionId,
    "chatId": "string"
  })
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as JSON body fields ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chatId` | string | yes | The FuseDesk chat ID. |
| `departmentId` | number | no | Assigned department ID. |
| `repId` | number | no | Assigned rep user ID. |
| `status` | string | no | Chat close status. |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native FuseDesk API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native FuseDesk API, this operation is `POST /api/v1/chats/:chatId/close` (base URL `https://{{credentials.appName}}.fusedesk.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/close-chat.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
