# folk: List Groups

Retrieves a list of groups from folk.

```
GET https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/folk/latest/actions/list-groups

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MINDCLOUD_API_KEY"
```

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  connectionId,
  limit: '25',
  offset: '0'
});

const response = await fetch(`https://connect.mindcloud.co/v1/universal/folk/latest/actions/list-groups?${params}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MINDCLOUD_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Native endpoint

Through the native folk API, this operation is `GET /v1/groups` (base URL `https://api.folk.app`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication and pagination. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-groups.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
