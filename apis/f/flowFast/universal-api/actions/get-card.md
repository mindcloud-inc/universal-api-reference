## Native endpoint

Through the native FlowFast API, this operation is `GET /cards/:cardId` (base URL `https://apps.flowfast.io/api/latest/`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-card.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
