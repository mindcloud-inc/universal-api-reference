## Native endpoint

Through the native Flow Blockchain API, this operation is `GET /collections/{id}` (base URL `https://rest-mainnet.onflow.org/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-collection.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
