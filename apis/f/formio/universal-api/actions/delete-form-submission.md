## Native endpoint

Through the native Form.io API, this operation is `DELETE /form/:formId/submission/:submissionId` (base URL `https://neabnzbnvbushtk.form.io`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/delete-form-submission.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
