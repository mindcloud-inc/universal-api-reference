## Native endpoint

Through the native Formatting API, this operation is `POST /post` (base URL `https://postman-echo.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/extract-url.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
