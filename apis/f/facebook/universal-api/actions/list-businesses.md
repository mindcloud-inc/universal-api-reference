## Native endpoint

Through the native Facebook API, this operation is `GET /me/businesses` (base URL `https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-businesses.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
