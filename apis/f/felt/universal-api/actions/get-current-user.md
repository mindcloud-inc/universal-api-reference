## Native endpoint

Through the native Felt API, this operation is `GET /user` (base URL `https://felt.com/api/v2`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-current-user.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
