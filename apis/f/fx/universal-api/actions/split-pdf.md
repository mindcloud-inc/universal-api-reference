    "file": "string"
  })
});

const { success, data } = await response.json();
```

## Inputs

Arguments are sent as JSON body fields ([conventions](../arguments.md)).

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | file | yes |  |
| `outputFormat` | string | no |  |

## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native 1001fx API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native 1001fx API, this operation is `POST /files/splitpdf` (base URL `https://api.1001fx.com`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/split-pdf.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
