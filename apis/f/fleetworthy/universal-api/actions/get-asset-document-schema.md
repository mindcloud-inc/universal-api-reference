## Response

The response envelope is `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": {} }`. The `data` schema for this action is dynamic; it mirrors what the native Fleetworthy API returns.

## Native endpoint

Through the native Fleetworthy API, this operation is `GET /assets/documents/schema` (base URL `https://apis.fleetworthy.com/compliance-api/v1`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/get-asset-document-schema.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
