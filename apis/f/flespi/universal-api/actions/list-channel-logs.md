## Native endpoint

Through the native Flespi API, this operation is `GET /gw/channels/all/logs` (base URL `https://flespi.io`). The Universal API call above is translated to it by MindCloud, including authentication. See the [native action reference](../../native-api/actions/list-channel-logs.md) for the provider-specific parameters and requirements.
